    -l       - Path to logfile. If not specified, STDOUT is used

To start the proxy server and bind it to port 22222 (the port on which it will
listen and accept connections)::

    proxy -p 22222

To start the proxy server, bind it to port 22222 and tell it to log all requests
to the file ``proxy.log``::
