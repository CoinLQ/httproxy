To start the proxy server and bind it to port 22222 (the port on which it will
listen and accept connections)::

    proxy -p 22222

To start the proxy server, bind it to port 22222 and tell it to log all requests
to the file ``proxy.log``::

    proxy -p 22222 -l proxy.log

To start the proxy server so it only allows connections from IP
``123.123.123.123``::

    proxy 123.123.123.123

To start the proxy server bound to port 22222, log to file ``proxy.log`` and run
the server in the background (as a daemon)::

    proxy -p 22222 -l proxy.log -d
